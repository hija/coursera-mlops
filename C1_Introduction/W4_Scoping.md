# Scoping process

1. Identify a business problem (NOT an AI problem!)
2. Brainstorm AI solutions to solve the problem
3. Assess the feasability and value of potential solutions
4. Determine milestones
5. Budget for resources

**Separate the problem (what to achieve) from the solution (how to achieve)**


## Is the project technically feasible?
--> Use external benchmark

For unstructured data look at the Human Level Performance to get an idea how a ML system could beform
For structured data ask if there are predictive features (i.e. features which correlate with the target variable) available

## Assessing the value of potential solutions
Problems: ML engineers and business departments have other definitions of success (e.g. training loss vs revenue)
--> Have both to agree on metrics both are comfortable with!

## Ethical considerations
* Is this project creating net positive value?
* Is the project reasonably fair and free from bias?

## Setting project milestones
Key specifications:
* ML metrics (accuracy, precision/recall, ...)
* Software metrics (latency, throughput, ...)
* Business metrics (revenue, ...)
* Resources needed (data, personnel, ...)
