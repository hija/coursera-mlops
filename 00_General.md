"MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is an emerging discipline, and comprises a set of tools and principles to support progress through the ML project lifecycle."

## General
* ML Code is just a very small part of the ML infrastructure. There is also... [(see D. Sculley et. al. NIPS 2015: Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf)
  * Configuration
  * Data Collection
  * Feature Extraction
  * Data Verification
  * Machine Resource Management
  * Analysis Tools
  * Process Management Tools
  * Serving Infrastructure
  * Monitoring
* Steps of ML-Project
  * Scope
    * Define the project (What are measurable goals?)
  * Data
    * Label and organize data
  * Modelling
    * Select and train model, perform error analysis
  * Deployment
    * Deploy into production
    * Monitor and maintain system (--> Look for Concept and Data Drift!)
